# Non Compliant Code

Standards and best practices evolve over time which means that code already
written may not comply with a new standard. If this is wide spread, it can lead
to a culture of ignoring the standard and can degreade the value of team
standards.

At a minimum, any code changed in a pull request complies with team standards.
The team values initiative updating code to comply with new standards and
recognises that this needs to be balanced with other priorities, such as
delivering new features of fixing bugs.

This ensures that:

1. code under active development is likely to be compliant with team standards,
2. less time is spent updating code that doesn't need to be updated frequently
   to new standards and
3. it encourages the team to go out of their way to implement any new standards
   as individuals see value in doing so.
