## Programming Language

If we develop in many different programming languages, the maintenance cost
increases, only those with knowledge of a given programming language can work
on code bases in that programming language and best practices and standards are
difficult to set across the team.

Any code will be written predominantly in Python.

This means we only have a dependency on contributors knowing one programming
language.
