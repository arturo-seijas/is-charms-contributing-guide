## Programming Language

If we develop in many different programming languages, the maintenance cost
increases, only those with knowledge of a given programming language can work
on code bases in that programming language and best practices and standards are
difficult to set across the team.

The team encourages exploration and experimentation in a range of programming
languages. For code intended for production, follow the programming language
commonly used in the ecosystem. For example, any charm code should be written
in Python and any contributions to juju should be in Go.

This means we only have a dependency on contributors knowing two programming
languages which reduces to one for those focussed on charm development.
