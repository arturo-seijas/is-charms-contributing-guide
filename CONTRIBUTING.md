## Programming Languages and Frameworks

If we develop in many different programming languages and frameworks, the
maintenance cost increases, only those with knowledge of a given programming
language or framework can work on code bases in that programming language and
best practices and standards are difficult to set across the team.

We are a team primarily focused on developing charms, and we should follow the
recommended tools and best practices of the ecosystem we work within (and help
to improve them where appropriate). As a result, the primary programming
language we work in is Python, and the primary framework we use to develop
charms with is the [Operator
Framework](https://github.com/canonical/operator).

We will also be working on older charms which may be written in older
frameworks such as the [Reactive
Framework](https://charmsreactive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). In some cases
we'll work on converting those to the Operator Framework but for small bug
fixes or changes this may not be the case.

As a team we'll also be exposed to a much lesser extent to other programming
languages as a result of working with specific applications that we deploy on
Juju, or via small changes to Juju itself, which is written in Go. We also
encourage exploration and experimentation in a range of programming languages
depending on the interest of the individual as part of using Canonical's
annual training budget.
